# reverse bubble sort
# It compares and sorts the adjacent element if they are in incorrect order
# In the each pass, between each adjacent element, the max element goes to the end
# loop 1- i element through all n elements
# loop 2 - j element will starts from second element, till nth element, with increments of 1 (travesing from right(max) to left(min)
# Time Complexity: O(n2)
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
